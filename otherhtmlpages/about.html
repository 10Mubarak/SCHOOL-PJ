      early beginnings, we have focused on developing well-rounded students—children who are curious, creative,
      responsible, and equipped with the skills needed to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Core Values</h3>
      <ul class="core-values">
        <li>
          <strong>Respect</strong> — We foster a culture where students learn to value themselves, others, and their
          environment. Respect shapes the way we communicate, collaborate, and grow as a community.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Curiosity</strong> — We believe learning begins with wonder. Students are encouraged to ask questions,
          explore new ideas, and develop a genuine love for discovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Excellence</strong> — We motivate every learner to reach their highest potential. Excellence is not
          just about performance—it’s about effort, integrity, and the determination to improve every day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community</strong> — Golden Age Academy thrives on unity and shared purpose. We work
          together—students, teachers, and families—to create a supportive, safe, and inspiring learning environment.
